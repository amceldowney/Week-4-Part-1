## Confidence intervals associated with a sample

```{r}
otter_length <- c(38,41,50,27,32,41,48,60,43)

t.test(otter_length)
```
## T-tests (1-sample t-test)

See a claim:  mean otter length is 50 inches

```{r}
otter_test <- t.test(x = otter_length, mu =50)
otter_test
```
## Two-sample t-test

```{r}
desert_bighorns <- c(32,44,18,26,50,33,42,30)
sierra_bighorns <- c(28,31,40,42,26,29,31)
t.test(x= desert_bighorns, y = sierra_bighorns)
```
